dosocs2
=======

dosocs2 is a command-line app for managing SPDX 2.0 documents and data. It can
scan software packages (e.g. tarballs) to produce SPDX information, store that
information in a relational database, and extract it in tag-value format
on request.

[SPDX](http://www.spdx.org) is a standard format for communicating information
about the licenses and copyrights associated with a software package. dosocs2
makes use of the SPDX 2.0 standard, released in May 2015.

dosocs2 is currently (July 2015) under heavy development; it should be
considered experimental, not production-ready, and subject to frequent
backwards-incompatible changes until a proper release.

### Current deviations from SPDX 2.0 specification

* Exactly one package per document is required. (SPDX 2.0 allows zero or more
  packages per document.)
* Files in a document can only exist within a package. (SPDX 2.0 allows files
  to exist outside of a package.)
* Checksums are always assumed to be SHA-1. (SPDX 2.0 permits SHA-1, SHA-256,
  and MD5)
* A file may be an artifact of only one project.
* License expression syntax is not supported.
* Deprecated fields from SPDX 1.2 (reviewer info and file dependencies) are not supported.

Dependencies
------------

- Python 2.7.x
- PostgreSQL 8.x or later version (can be on a separate machine)
- <a href="http://www.fossology.org/">FOSSology</a> 2.5.x or later version

### Python libraries

- [docopt](http://docopt.org/)
- [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/)
- [psycopg2](http://initd.org/psycopg/)
- [python-magic](https://github.com/ahupp/python-magic)
- [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/)

All Python dependencies are handled by the setup script.


Installation
------------

First off, I recommend installing and running `dosocs2` inside a Python
[virtualenv](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/), but it
is in no way a requirement.

Grab the latest release--or, if you are feeling adventurous, clone the
repository--and use `pip` to install it as a package. If you are not inside a
virtualenv you may have to run `pip` as root.

    $ pip install ./dosocs2

You will have to create the `spdx` (or whatever you want to call it) role and
database yourself (although I recommend setting a different password than the
one given...):

    postgres=# create role spdx with login password 'spdx';
    postgres=# create database spdx with owner spdx;


Generate an initial config file:

    $ dosocs2 newconfig
    dosocs2: wrote config file to /home/tgurney/.config/dosocs2/dosocs2.conf

Then open up the config file and make sure you are pointed to the correct
PostgreSQL server, with a valid username/password. You also need to set the
path of the default `nomos` scanner (part of FOSSology) if it is not already
correct.

Finally, to create all necessary tables and views in the database:

    $ dosocs2 dbinit


Usage
-----

The simplest use case is scanning a package, generating a
document, and printing the document in one shot:

    $ dosocs2 oneshot package.tar.gz
    document_id: 1
    package_id: 1
    [... document output here ...]

Also works on directories:

    $ dosocs2 oneshot ./path/to/directory

The scan results and other collected metadata are saved in the database
so that subsequent document generations will be much faster.

To scan a package and store its information in the database:

    $ dosocs2 scan package.tar.gz
    package_id: 456

No document has been created yet. To create one in the database (specifying the
package ID):

    $ dosocs2 generate 456
    document_id: 123

Then, to compile and output the document in tag-value format:

    $ dosocs2 print 123
    [... document output here ...]


History
-------

dosocs2 owes its name and concept to the
[DoSOCS](https://github.com/socs-dev-env/DoSOCS) tool created by Zach
McFarland, which in turn was spun off from the `do_spdx` plugin for Yocto
Project, created by Jake Cloyd and Liang Cao.

dosocs2 aims to fill the same role as DoSOCS, but with support for SPDX 2.x, a
larger feature set, and a more modular implementation, among other changes.
