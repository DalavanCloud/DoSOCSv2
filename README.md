dosocs2
=======

dosocs2 is a command-line tool for managing SPDX 2.0 documents and data. It can
scan source code distributions to produce SPDX information, store that
information in a relational database, and extract it in a plain-text format
on request.

dosocs2 enables easy creation of a "bill of materials" for any software package,
and can even be used in the creation and continuous maintenance of an inventory
of all open-source software used in an organization.

[SPDX](http://www.spdx.org) is a standard format for communicating information
about the contents of a software package, including license and copyright
information. dosocs2 supports the SPDX 2.0 standard, released in May 2015.

dosocs2 is under heavy development; expect frequent backwards-incompatible
changes until a 1.x.x release!

### Current deviations from SPDX 2.0 specification

* Exactly one package per document is required. (SPDX 2.0 allows zero or more
  packages per document.)
* Files in a document can only exist within a package. (SPDX 2.0 allows files
  to exist outside of a package.)
* Checksums are always assumed to be SHA-1. (SPDX 2.0 permits SHA-1, SHA-256,
  and MD5)
* A file may be an artifact of only one project.
* License expression syntax is not parsed; license expressions are interpreted as license
  names that are not on the SPDX license list.
* Deprecated fields from SPDX 1.2 (reviewer info and file dependencies) are not supported.

Dependencies
------------

- Python 2.7.x
- [FOSSology](http://www.fossology.org/) 2.5.x or later version (for
  license identification)
- Optional: PostgreSQL 8.x or later version (can be on a separate machine)

### Python libraries

- [docopt](http://docopt.org/)
- [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/)
- [psycopg2](http://initd.org/psycopg/) (if not using the PostgreSQL
  configuration, this dependency can be safely removed from `setup.py`
  prior to install)
- [python-magic](https://github.com/ahupp/python-magic)
- [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/)
- [xmltodict](https://github.com/martinblech/xmltodict)

All Python dependencies are handled automatically by `pip`.


Installation
------------

First off, I recommend installing and running `dosocs2` inside a Python
[virtualenv](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/), but it
is not a requirement.

[Grab the latest release](https://github.com/ttgurney/dosocs2/releases)
and use `pip` to install it as a package. If you are not inside a virtualenv
you may have to run `pip` as root (not recommended!). Replace `0.x.x` with
the latest release version number.

    $ tar xf 0.x.x.tar.gz 
    $ pip install ./dosocs2-0.x.x

After successful install, generate an initial config file:

    $ dosocs2 newconfig
    dosocs2: wrote config file to /home/tgurney/.config/dosocs2/dosocs2.conf

The default config uses a SQLite database. Open up the config file and change
the database file path in variable `connection_uri` to whatever path you
like, e.g.:

    connection_uri = sqlite:////home/tgurney/.dosocs2.sqlite3

If you have [FOSSology](http://www.fossology.org/) installed, you also need
to set the path of the default `nomos` scanner if it is not already correct.

Finally, to create all necessary tables and views in the database:

    $ dosocs2 dbinit


### Using dosocs2 with PostgreSQL

You will have to create the `spdx` (or whatever name you want) role and
database yourself.  I recommend setting a different password than the
one given...:

    postgres=# create role spdx with login password 'spdx';
    postgres=# create database spdx with owner spdx;

Then change the `connection_uri` variable in your `dosocs2.conf`:

    # connection_uri = postgresql://user:pass@host:port/database
    connection_uri = postgresql://spdx:spdx@localhost:5432/spdx

Run `dosocs2 dbinit` again to set up, and you're good to go. 


Usage
-----

The simplest use case is scanning a package, generating a
document, and printing the document in one shot:

    $ dosocs2 oneshot package.tar.gz
    document_id: 1
    package_id: 1
    [... document output here ...]

Also works on directories:

    $ dosocs2 oneshot ./path/to/directory

The scan results and other collected metadata are saved in the database
so that subsequent document generations will be much faster.

To scan a package and store its information in the database:

    $ dosocs2 scan package.tar.gz
    package_id: 456

No document has been created yet. To create one in the database (specifying the
package ID):

    $ dosocs2 generate 456
    document_id: 123

Then, to compile and output the document in tag-value format:

    $ dosocs2 print 123
    [... document output here ...]


History
-------

dosocs2 owes its name and concept to the
[DoSOCS](https://github.com/socs-dev-env/DoSOCS) tool created by Zach
McFarland, which in turn was spun off from the `do_spdx` plugin for Yocto
Project, created by Jake Cloyd and Liang Cao.

dosocs2 aims to fill the same role as DoSOCS, but with support for SPDX 2.x, a
larger feature set, and a more modular implementation, among other changes.
