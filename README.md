dosocs2
=======

dosocs2 is a command-line app for managing SPDX 2.0 documents and data. It can
scan software packages (e.g. tarballs) to produce SPDX information, store that
information in a relational database, and extract it in RDF or tag-value format
on request.

[SPDX](http://www.spdx.org) is a standard format for communicating information
about the licenses and copyrights associated with a software package. dosocs2
makes use of the SPDX 2.0 standard, released in May 2015.

dosocs2 is currently (June 2015) under heavy development; it should be
considered experimental, not production-ready, and subject to frequent
backwards-incompatible changes until a proper release.
